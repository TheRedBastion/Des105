Welcome to your new job as a park ranger!

Our national parks are a staple of our beautiful country, 
and we have employed your help to keep our parks in tip top
shape. Despite this, we have had many issue in the past with
visitors harming our beautiful wildlife, and its up to you
to report any accidents in our park. 

We have employed you for a 12-hour shift throughout the week
where it is your job to check the cameras to spot any "incidents"
and report them with your big red button (convenient huh?) to 
alert us to that location to clear everything up.

However we are strict with our employees, and will not tolerate
people pressing the button UNLESS there is an emergency. Additionally,
for every incident that goes unreported, we will notify you by
increasing the fire bar to the right of your screen, 3 strikes and you're
out.

Best of luck to you on your first week!
